# Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm 

## GENERAL USAGE NOTES

- Program in this repository implements Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and sends it to real quantum computer at IBM Quantum. Link: https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/
- Data folder contains results of our evaluations using our code for different inputs hard-coded into the program.
- Code was originally run in Python 3.8.
- License (GNU) can be found in LICENSE.md file.

## HOW TO RUN

- Follow the instructions from Qiskit to setup the envornment to run the code. https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html
- Open `dj_algorithm.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.


## CODE MANUAL

The code consists of two functions `generate_oracle(mode, inputs)` and `dj_algorithm(oracle, inputs)`.

### generate_oracle(mode, inputs):

Generates oracle for the `dj_algorithm`.
- `mode` is string, either 'balanced' for balanced oracle or 'constant' for constant oracle
- `inputs` determines number of qubits used in the input

### dj_algorithm(oracle, inputs):

- `oracle` is oracle generated by function `generate_oracle`
- `inputs` determines number of qubits used in the input

## DATA RESULTS

Results are divided into two csv files, one for balanced function and one for constant function.
Format is as follows:
- `Number of qubits` - number of qubits used to run each test
- `Output` - string of the output we got
- `Occurrences` - how much given output occurred
